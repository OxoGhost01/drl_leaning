# Hi

Welcome to my repo where i post the code i did (or i'm currently working on) to learn DRL.

For that i use [this course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction), it's pretty detailed and i prefer texte-based courses rather than video-based ones x)

Fell free to explore, ask something, take the files or use it for something else, as long as you mention me.

Have fun !
